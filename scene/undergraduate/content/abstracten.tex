The current industry is confronted with the significant issue of low efficiency in constructing test scenarios for autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes a novel generation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with formal scenario description languages. The purpose of this framework is to efficiently transform natural language descriptions into high-fidelity 3D test scenarios. It comprises three core modules. The first is a domain knowledge - enhanced instruction parsing module, which can accurately understand the test scenario requirements in natural language descriptions and thus lay the foundation for subsequent generation tasks. The second is a syntax - semantics dual - verification code generation mechanism, which can ensure that the generated Scenic code is not only syntactically correct but also semantically logical in accordance with the actual scenario, thereby enhancing the usability and accuracy of the code. The third is a physics - rule - driven scenario synthesis engine, which can reasonably generate 3D scenarios based on physical rules to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the scenarios. The system has demonstrated excellent performance in experiments conducted on the CARLA simulation platform.
